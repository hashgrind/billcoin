What is Billcoin?
----------------

Billcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Billcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Billcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Billcoin Core software, see [https://billcoin.xyz](https://billcoin.xyz).

What is Billcoin Really?
-----------------------

Billcoin is a ripoff, uhh, is heavily inspired by that other well known scrypt-based cryptocurrency. We lub you litecoin.

It has the following significant improvements: 1000x money supply cap (84,000,000,000 BIL max), 10x faster coinbase maturity (i.e. more immature money), better base58 values/other naming, etc. Various surprise changes left as a pleasant surprise/shock.

You shouldn't use this for anything.
