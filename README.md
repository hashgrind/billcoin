Billcoin Core
=====================================

What is Billcoin?
----------------

Billcoin is a process of religious observance, reflecting a unified sense of all holiness in digital form -- imperfectly, with ever increasing closeness to the divine, as the Billcoin blockchain is created. The Billcoin network connects all followers of Billcoin in a shared religious practice.

Worship is conducted via the art created by Billcoin. This is due to Billcoin also being a distributed artistic expression; it is an ever-evolving interactive work of creativity, collectively creating the Billcoin blockchain work of art, in successive approximations of the divine. The artistic expression collectively is evolved through interaction with the Billcoin blockchain and the Billcoin network.

What Billcoin is Not
----------------

Billcoin is not an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Billcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing Billcoin are carried
out collectively by the network. Billcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of Billcoin.

Billcoin is neither money, nor a currency, nor a security.

Billcoin does not have value.

How Did Billcoin Happen?
------------------------

Billcoin is a ripoff, uhh, is heavily inspired by that other well known scrypt-based
cryptothing that rhymes with fight coin.

It has the following significant "improvements:" 1000x money supply cap (84,000,000,000 BIL max),
halving every 840,000,000 BIL, 10x faster coinbase maturity (i.e. more immature money),
twice daily-targeted difficulty rebalancing, blocks targeted every 15 sec,
superior base58 values/other naming, etc. Various surprise changes left as a pleasant surprise/shock.

Easter eggs and inside jokes abound.

You almost definitely shouldn't use this for anything.

Appropriate Usages of Billcoin
------------------------------

Do not use Billcoin.

How to Mistakes and Regrets
---------------------------

1. Clone the code.

2. Build it (look in `doc`). If you get Mac/Windows working, I'll give you some BIL.

3. Run a node (e.g. `billcoind` and `billcoin-` and/or `Billcoin-Qt`) and connect to the Billcoin network.

4. (Optional) Generate an address and start mining Billcoin and participating in the security of the
Billcoin network.
