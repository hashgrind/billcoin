Billcoin Core
=====================================

What is Billcoin?
----------------

Billcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Billcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Billcoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

What is Billcoin Really?
-----------------------

Billcoin is a ripoff, uhh, is heavily inspired by that other well known scrypt-based
cryptocurrency. We lub you litecoin.

It has the following significant "improvements:" 1000x money supply cap (84,000,000,000 BIL max),
halving every 840,000,000 BIL, 10x faster coinbase maturity (i.e. more immature money),
twice daily-targeted difficulty rebalancing, blocks targeted every 15 sec,
superior base58 values/other naming, etc. Various surprise changes left as a pleasant surprise/shock.

Easter eggs and inside jokes abound.

You almost definitely shouldn't use this for anything.

How to Mistakes and Regrets
---------------------------

1. Clone the code.

2. Build it (look in `doc`). If you get Mac/Windows working, I'll give you some BIL.

3. Run a node (e.g. `billcoind` and `billcoin-` and/or `Billcoin-Qt`) and connect to the Billcoin network.

4. (Optional) Generate an address and start mining Billcoin and participating in the security of the
Billcoin network.
